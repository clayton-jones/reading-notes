# Class 27 Reading - Custom Hooks  

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?**  

    *From the React documentation: "This convention is very important. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it."*  

2. **What do custom hooks usually do?**  

    *Custom hooks usually modularize logic to be shared between components.*  

3. **Using the links above, list one custom hook that you would be interested in trying/using.**  

    *On the React Documentation they outlined a custom hook to detect if your friend is online. There looks to be a lot of other stuff going on with the chat app but that would be cool to try and implement somewhere.*
