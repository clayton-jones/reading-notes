# Class 21 Reading - Component Based UI  

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **What is the benefit of breaking up HTML webpage content into components?**  

    *Breaking up an HTML webpage into components allows you to reuse those pieces whenever and wherever is necessary, instead of repeating code.*  

2. **What is JSX? Why is it useful?**  

    *JSX stands for JavaScript XML, which is the combination of JavaScript and HTML in one file. It is useful because it allows us to craete functions or classes that can be imported into an app to build out content on the page.*  

3. **What can cause a render (or re-render) of a component?**  

    *The rerender of a component happens when a state variable changes.* 

4. **When a render happens, how is the DOM affected**  

    *The DOM updates for that specific block of HTML only, making rerenders fast and efficient.*  

5. **What is one thing a framework does that a library doesnâ€™t do?**  

    *A framework sets up rigid places to call your code, where a library lets you import and use it's pieces where you see fit.*
