# Class 15 Reading - DSA: Trees  

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?**  

    *A leaf node is a node without any subsequent edges or connections. It is important to be able to find leaf nodes because that is typically where you would add new nodes?*  

2. **Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order?**  

    *Pre-order follows root >> left >> right. In-order follows left >> root >> right. And post-order follows left >> right >> root.*  

3. **What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?**  

    *N? It could be any height... This is used for sorting? idk. the reading doesn't say unless I missed it.* 

4. **How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?**  

    *Stacks and queues are used in different types of tree traversals, by adding to the stack/queue during recursion.*
