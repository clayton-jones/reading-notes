## Discussion Questions:

1. **What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?**  
  
    *One benefit of not enforcing type is allowing for flexibility in the code*  
    
2. **What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?**  
  
    *Because JS doesn't enforce type, you can get into situations where your variables don't contain the types of data you are expecting, which can be difficult to debug*  
    
3. **Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?**  
   
    *No, functions should strive to be pure functions, which have no side effects, which include altering external variables. This makes it easier to test when output of a function is the same each time it is called with the same input.*  
    
4. **Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?**  
  
    *A string is a data type that has rules. It can only be made up of characters. Characters can only be [A_Za-z0-9] as well as any special character.*
