# Class 16 Reading - Event Driven Applications  

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?**  

    *A new server request is made, or api route hit.*  

2. **Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?**  

    *You can have multiple actions take place on a single event, where having multiple callbacks can get messy.*  

3. **What does an EventEmitter instance do?**  

    *It allows us to add/remove event listeners, and trigger events* 

4. **When is a programâ€™s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?**  

    *Whenever events are taking place. But they are always listening/waiting for them to happen.*
