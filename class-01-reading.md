# Class 01 Reading - Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

## Discussion Questions:

1. **Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?** 
   
    *Running JavaScript outside of a browser gives you the ability to incoorporate a database, APIs, events, and other third party tools to increase the complexity of your applications.* 
  
2. **What is the difference between a module and a package?** 
    
    *Modules are chunks of code, like functions, that are meant to be pulled into applications to be used. Packages are an extension of modules. They allow developers to create complex chunks of code that can be published and shared with other devs.*

3. **What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?**  
    
    *One benefit of TDD is that you plan out what your code should be doing **BEFORE** you write the code, so there is less ambiguity and uncertainty during the development process.*

4. **What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?**  
    
    *One potential downside of TDD is that it slows down your initial development, but should make up for that with the certainty it provides down the road.*

5. **What does the node package manager do?**  
    
    *The node package manager facilitates the install of local and global packages that you can then utilize inside your applications or terminal.*
