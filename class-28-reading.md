# Class 28 Reading - Context API  

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **What is the difference between the variables MyContext and MyProvider in the examples above?**  

    *MyContext is created through the 'react' package, while MyProvider is just a potato component that was created for demonstration purposes. It is essentially the 'parent' that is passing it's state to other components.*  

2. **Why is context useful?**  

    *Context allows you to pass cariables directly to any decendent component, without having to pass it through a chain of props.*  

3. **Can a component outside of a provider get its context?**  

    *No.*
