# Class 11 Reading - DSA: Stacks and Queues

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a stack.**  

    *You may want to use a stack when tracking actions in a word processor or maybe a rawing pad, so you can undo/redo actions.*  

2. **Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a queue.**  

    *You may want to use a queue if you are collecting user issues/complaints in an IT department, so that you can address them in the order that they are received.*  

3. **Why are pop, push, enqueue and dequeue always O(1)?**  

    *It is always O(1) because you don't have to traverse anything, therefore it will always take the same amount of time no matter how many nodes are present.* 

4. **Why do stacks and queues not have traversal or searching operations?**  

    *Stacks and queues do not have traversals because you only care about the items at the top (for stacks) and on either end (for queues). The items below or in between are not relevant until they reach the top/front.*
