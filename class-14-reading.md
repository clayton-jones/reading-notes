# Class 14 Reading - Access Control 

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.**  

    *Access control is important because you can delegate control within an application, so only certain people can update, delete, or otherwise change/see stuff. In the world of fremium applications, you would restrict some sections to only be viewable by premium members.*  

2. **What is a role used for?**  

    *A role is used to determine what permissions that user has.*  

3. **Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**  

    *This allows developers to edit roles without effecting user data.*
