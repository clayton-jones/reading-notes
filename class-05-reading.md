# Class 05 Reading - Linked Lists

## Discussion Questions:

1. **What is a data structure?**  

    *A data structure is a term used to describe certain architectures (or ways of holding data) within programming.*  

2. **How is a Linked List different from an array?**  

    *An array is a rigid piece of data, where a Linked List is more flexible, especially in older languages like Java and C++.*  

3. **What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?**  

    *Adding to a Linked List is not as costly as expanding on an array.*

4. **What data does a Node hold in a doubly Linked List?**  

    *A doubly Linked List Node contains it's data, as well as links to both the next Node, and the previous Node.*  

5. **What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)**  

    *Probably an object that has properties for the data it's holding, as well as the next/previous Nodes.*
