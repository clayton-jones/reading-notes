## Discussion Questions:

1. **Why would a developer choose to make data models?**  

    *Data models allow a developer to have more control over what types of data get entered, as well as manipulating 'good' data so that it is predicatable.*

2. **What purpose do CRUD operations serve?**  

    *CRUD operations allow you to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data within your data model. Maybe.*

3. **What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?**  

    *Postgres is an SQL database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database.*

4. **What is Mongoose and why do we need it?**  

    *Mongoose is a translator that translates JavaScript into a language that MongoDB can understand.*

5. **Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the contraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.**  

    *Country, Region, Currency*  

    *Each country has a specific currency, as well as belongs to a specific region.*
