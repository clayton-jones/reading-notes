# Class 19 Reading - Message Queues  

## Discussion Questions:  
  
1. **What is the main benefit of a message queue server?**  

    *The main benefit is allowing connected sockets to subscribe to specific queues, so they only get those messages. It also allows you do pull down previous messages that were sent while disconnected.*  

2. **Why might we want to initiate messages from an HTTP request?**  

    *Perhaps this allows for more flexibility and scalability down the road?*  

3. **Is the Message Queue Server a socket.io client, a socket.io server, or an api server?**  

    *The queue server is a socket.io server.*
