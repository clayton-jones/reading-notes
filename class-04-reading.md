## Discussion Questions:

1. **What makes an interface useful?**  
  
    *An interface is a simplified way of allowing someone to enact more complex operations. It also standardizes how operations are referenced.*  

2. **Why is middleware called middleware?**  
  
    *Middleware gets its name because it is exactly that, software that works in the "middle" of two other pieces of software. It can add functionality, or enable the interaction between them.*  

3. **Fundamentally, what does it mean to have a mock of something? Why is this useful?**  

    *When you mock something, you are creating a "fake" copy of it that acts exactly like the real version, but it only exists in a limited space, for a limited time.*  

4. **What does it mean to have a mock database?**  

    *When you mock a database, you are creating a copy that has the same structure as the real database, with all the same functionality, but when you run tests, the data in the real database is not touched.*
